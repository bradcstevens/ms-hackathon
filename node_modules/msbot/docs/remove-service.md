## Disconnecting a service
You can remove a service by using the disconnect command:

```shell
msbot disconnect [serviceid_or_name]
```
Where *serviceid_or_name* is the id or name of the connected service.
Example using a name:
```shell
msbot disconnect MyLuisApp
```
Example using ID:
```shell
msbot disconnect <ID>
```
